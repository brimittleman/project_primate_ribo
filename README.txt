This repo hosts scripts developed for processing and analyzing ribosome profiling data generated from lymphoblastoid cell lines each derived from different individuals of three primate species (human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque). The results of these analyses are published in XXXXX. Processed datasets are also included for reproducing the analyses. Please note that adjustments to conform with local environment and directory path are likely required for the bash scripts to work. The map_bwa.sh script was adapted (with minor modifications) from a similar script created by Darren Cusanovich, who wrote the original script for processing the RNA-Seq dataset reported in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24136357.

R code used for analyses performed for this project is stored in the Rmd files in the analysis directory. The Rmd files load data objects stored in the rdas directory. The tables and figures directories contain output from running the Rmd files. The bash_scripts directory contains scripts used for processing the sequencing data in order to produce the quantification tables.
